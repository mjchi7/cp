## Preliminaries
Step by step tutorial : https://redash.io/help/open-source/dev-guide/setup
### Redis server

#### Installation
Firstly, install the [`redis`](https://linode.com/docs/databases/redis/install-and-configure-redis-on-centos-7/) server. If OS is CentOS, type the following command
```
sudo yum install redis
```

Next, run the `redis` server using the following command
```
sudo systemctl start redis
```

(*OPTIONAL*) To start `redis` on boot
```
sudo systemctl enable redis
```

To check whether the server has been correctly start up, type the following command
```
redis-cli ping
```
If the terminal output `PONG`, redis server is up and running.

### PostgreSQL
#### Installation
Installation steps depend heavily on your OS. In the steps below, commands showed are only applicable to CentOS7. For more information refers to [PostgreSQL Official Site](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/redhat/)

Firstly, install the repository so that the package is visible to our `yum` package manager
```
yum install https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/11/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/pgdg-centos11-11-2.noarch.rpm
```

Next, proceed to install `postgresql11` and its server counterparts
```
yum install postgresql11
yum install postgresql11-server
```

Then, initialize the database as well as start running it.
```
/usr/pgsql-11/bin/postgresql-11-setup initdb  
systemctl enable postgresql-11  
systemctl start postgresql-11
```

#### Configuration
After PostgreSQL has been installed, there will be only 1 default user which can access the database: `postgres`

To add more user, follow the steps below:

1. To access the database with your current local user name, you need to add it into the database by issuing the following command
	`sudo -u postgres createuser redash`
	The command will create a user `redash` (so that user log into the server with username `redash` can use the database server, which is needed for redash setup stage).
	
2. Log into the database
	`sudo -u postgres psql`
	
3. To see the list of users, issue the command `\du`. From the list you should be able to see there are currently two users: `postgres` and `redash` (the one we created in step 1. 
4. 
5. Assign `CREATEDB` role to user `redash` with the following query
	`ALTER USER redash WITH SUPERUSER,CREATEDB`
	When the query execute, user `redash` will have superuser access to the database (Which is needed to set up redash)
	
6. Issue `\q` to quit the `psql` environment.

### MySQL 
If you intend to use MySQL as one of your data source, dependencies must be installed in order to make sure the following installation can be done without problem.
#### Installation
##### Dependencies 

## Installting ReDASH

1. FOLLOWS STEPS
 https://redash.io/help/open-source/dev-guide/setup
** REMEMBER TO ADD IN THE STEP WHERE YOU PIP INSTALL REQUIREMENTS_ALL_DS.TXT **

BLA

Create db table 
```
bin/run ./manage.py database create_tables
```

RUNNING THE SERVICES

1. Web server:  `bin/run ./manage.py runserver --debugger --reload`
2. Celery:  `./bin/run celery worker --app=redash.worker --beat -Qscheduled_queries,queries,celery -c2`
3. Webpack dev server:  `npm run start`

To start Web server at `'0.0.0.0'`, simply add the `--host` command line argument as shown below
`bin/run ./manage.py runserver --debugger --reload --host 0.0.0.0`

## Issues
### 1. Error 111 connecting to localhost:6379. Connection refused. 
When this issue shows up, it means the `redis` server is not installed and/or not running. Refers to **Preliminaries** step in this document to see how to set up properly.

### 2. sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (psycopg2.OperationalError) could not connect to server: No such file or directory. Is the server running locally and accepting connections on Unix domain socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432"? 
When this issue shows up, it means the `PostgreSQL` server is not installed and/or not running. Refers to **Preliminaries** step in this document to see how to set up properly.

### 3. Redash claims that they support 25 data sources, but I can only see some of them! 
This happens if you didn't `pip install -r requirements_all_ds.txt`, which means all the needed database dependencies weren't installed, hence you can't see all the data source interface when you try to add new data source.

To fix this, simply run the following command on the project folder that contains the forked redash
`pip install -r requirements_all_ds.txt`

### 4. When pip installing *requirements_all_ds.txt*, MySQL-Python failed to build!
In order for mysql to build successfully, make sure you have the following dependencies installed using your OS package manager (in CentOS, it is *yum*)

```
yum install mariadb-devel
yum install openssl-devel
```

### 5. When building MySQL-Python, it complains that I am lacking two packages: "cannot find -lssl; cannot find -lcrypto;. 
This issue is similar to issue 4, which means the dependencies **openssl-devel** is not installed. [Relevant read](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25979525/cannot-find-lssl-cannot-find-lcrypto-when-installing-mysql-python-using-mar)
